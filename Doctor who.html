<H1><p style="color:DodgerBlue;">Doctor who</H1>
<H2><p style="color:DodgerBlue;">By Fernando Osborn (Nando Perry Perry Chicken)</H2>
<H3><p style="color:DodgerBlue;">Doctor who is a Brittish television show invented in the 1900's and continued on till now.
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">As the doctor is a time travelling alien from Gallifrey, when he dies, he regenerates into a
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">different person. This means that he never dies but his personality and appearance changes.
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">The doctor has alien technology called a 'TARDIS'. This stands for Time And Relative Dimensions In Space.
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">The doctor's TARDIS can travel through time and space. Not only can the TARDIS do all of these things,
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">but it is also bigger on the inside and can produce technology. Every episode, there is an alien threat that the doctor
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">needs to thwart for the safety of the human race.
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">The doctor's enemies:
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">Zygons
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">Daleks
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">Cybermen
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">Vespiforms
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">Vashta Nerada
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">Time Lords (occasionally)
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">Weeping angels
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">The great intelligence
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">Prisoner zero
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">Many more

<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">The TARDIS (above)
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">The doctor also has many different tools including his 'sonic screwdriver'
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">The sonic screwdriver:
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">Unlocks locks (excluding deadlocks)
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">Scans lifeforms
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">Messes with technology
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">Messes with natural material

<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">Sonic screwdrivers of the 10th, 11th and 12th doctors (above)
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">So far, there have been 13 different doctors (excluding meta crisis and war)
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">1st doctor:
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">Played by:
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">William Hartnell

<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">Ian Chesterton
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">Vicki
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">Steven Taylor
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">Katarina
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">A bit about him:
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">The first doctor was warm and witty. He could be mean and sometimes, unforgiving.
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">The first doctor had many companions including his granddaughter.
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">The first doctor was originally from Gallifrey, but stole a TARDIS so he could explore
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">the universe, and as he tells people, 'because he was bored.'

<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">The 1st doctor (above)

<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">Victoria Waterfield
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">Deborah Watling
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">Zoe Heriot
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">A bit about him:
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">The second doctor was remarked to be quite different to the first. He was funny,
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">forgiving, friendly and warm. He had about the same amount of companions and
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">was quite similar though had quite a different, more fun and jocular personality
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">than the 1st doctor.

<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">Leela
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">K9
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">Romana
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">A bit about him:
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">The third doctor was quite quirky, but after his forced regeneration by the time lords,
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">he was abandoned on the planet earth where he had forgotten how to use his Tardis.
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">He decided to work for UNIT. The earth's UNited Intelligence Taskforce. These people
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">Tracked down alien threats and helped the doctor stop them. One of his closest friends
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">While working for UNIT was Brigadier Lethbridge Stewart.

<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">The 3rd doctor (above)
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">The 4th doctor:
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">Played by:
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">Tom Baker
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">Companions:
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">Sarah Jane Smith
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">Harry Sullivan
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">Leela

<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">K9 Mark II

<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">Romana II (regenerated form of Romana I)
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">Adric
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">Nyssa
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">Tegan Jovanka
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">A bit about him:
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">The fourth doctor was an extremely quirky doctor, possibly the quirkiest up till the
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">eleventh doctor. He was kind and caring and was one of the public's favourite doctors.
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">The fourth doctor regained his ability to fly the TARDIS and near the end of his regeneration,
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">Became the supreme commander of the time lords. After his regeneration, he ran away
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">as he couldn't handle this responsibility.

<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">The 4th doctor (above)
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">The 5th doctor:
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">Played by:
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">Peter Davison
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">Companions:
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">Adric
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">Nyssa
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">Tegan Jovanka
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">Vislor Turlough
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">Kamelion
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">Peri Brown
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">A bit about him:
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">The fifth doctor was the youngest of the doctors up till the eleventh doctor.
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">He was a kind doctor and didn't like battle. Most of the time, he would avoid it
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">at all costs. He wore a stick of celery on his top as he was allergic to gasses
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">that would turn celery purple. He was particularly fond of cricket.

<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">The 5th doctor (above)
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">The 6th doctor:
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">Played by:
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">Colin Baker
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">Companions:
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">Peri Brown
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">Mel Bush
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">A bit about him:
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">The sixth doctor was one of the quirkiest doctors with flamboyant clothes and a patronising
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">personality. He was kind but sometimes patronising and had a crazy taste in clothes.
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">His love for question marks transitioned into the 7th doctor's love for question marks, but
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">he had a lot less question marks on his attire than his future regeneration.
<p><img src="6th_doctor.jpg" height=700 width=500>
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">The 6th doctor (above)
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">The 7th doctor:
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">Played by:
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">Sylvester McCoy
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">Companions:
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">Mel Bush
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">Ace
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">A bit about him:
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">The seventh doctor was kind and caring and cared a lot for Ace. He had a personality
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">that set him apart from other doctors as he frequently used reverse psychology to get what
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">he needed. He also put challenges for his companions and character building things without
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">them knowing and after each challenge, they grew as a person.
<p><img src="7th_doctor.jpg" height=700 width=500>
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">The 7th doctor (above)
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">The 8th doctor:
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">Played by:
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">Paul McGann
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">Companions:
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">Grace Holloway
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">A bit about him:
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">The eighth doctor is the last regeneration before the war doctor. He is romantic and kind.
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">He is also passionate, enthusiastic and eccentric. At first, he blames Grace Holloway
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">for his regeneration, but then comes to befriend her and she becomes one of his companions.
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">He wants to take no part in the time war, but at the end of his life, just before his
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">regeneration, he crash lands on Karn changing everything.
<p><img src="8th_doctor.jpg" height=400 width=500>
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">The eighth doctor (above)
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">The war doctor:
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">Played by:
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">John Hurt
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">Companions:
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">None.
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">A bit about him:
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">The war doctor is the regeneration after the 8th doctor. He is angry and wants to destroy
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">the daleks and save all of his people. He tries to end the suffering but does not succeed.
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">Eventually, he steals a piece of time lord technology called 'the moment' and if he pushes
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">the button, he will end the suffering by killing everyone on the planet (including the time lords)
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">but him. This would mean that he would end the suffering but kill billions of people.
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">It seems as though he pushed the button, but as later told in 'the day of the doctor'
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">a 50th aniversary episode of Doctor who, the 11th doctor, the 10th and the war doctor
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">all team up and try to defeat zygons. Just before he initiates the 'moment', the other
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">doctors come up to him and stop him from doing it with the help of Clara (a future companion)
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">At the end of the episode, all of the doctors unite and pull Gallifrey and all of the
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">time lords (not the daleks) into an alternate dimension where they are safe but no one
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">can find them. This means that he did not kill all of those people, but saved them all from eternal
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">suffering. Because of the time line, his future regenerations do not remember this
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">(excluding 11th onwards) so they still feel regret and that regret, as the war doctor puts it,
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">saves billions of galaxies and lives.
<p><img src="War_doctor.jpg" height=650 width=500>
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">The war doctor (above)
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">The 9th doctor:
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">Played by:
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">Christopher Eccleston
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">Companions:
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">Rose Tyler
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">Adam Mitchell
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">Captain Jack Harkness
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">A bit about him:
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">The ninth doctor was kind and because he didn't remember all the doctors uniting to save
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">the time lords, he was very regretful and it is said that he didn't make a single bad
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">decicion or unkind decicion in all of his life. He was warm and witty and was well know
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">for his big nose and ears. He was sometimes unforgiving but most of the time, an amazing doctor.
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">He was specifically made less eccentric as he is full of regret from the time war.
